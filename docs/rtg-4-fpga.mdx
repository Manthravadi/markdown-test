# RTG4 FPGA

![RTG4 FPGA](/img/pages/rtg-4-fpga/rtg-4-fpga-banner.png "RTG4 FPGA")
<br />

Our RTG4 FPGAs can implement designs for harsh radiation environments such as space flights. They integrate a fourth-generation Flash-based FPGA fabric and SerDes on a single chip.
 - Radiation-hardened by design, Flash-based FPGA with proven flight heritage
 - Up to 150,000 Logic Elements and 3.125 Gbps SerDes
 - Qualified to QML class Q and QML class V
