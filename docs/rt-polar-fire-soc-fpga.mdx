# RT PolarFire SOC FPGA

![RT PolarFire SOC FPGA](/img/pages/rt-polar-fire-soc-fpga/rt-polar-fire-soc-fpga-banner.png "RT PolarFireSOC  FPGA")
<br />

Designed to enable high-performance data processing, our radiation-tolerant PolarFire SoC FPGA is the industry’s first embedded, real-time, Linux®-capable, RISC-V®-based Microprocessor Subsystem (MSS) on the flight-proven RT PolarFire FPGA fabric. With our extensive Mi-V ecosystem, designers can develop lower-power solutions for the challenging thermal environments seen in space.
 - Quad core, 64-bit RISC-V application-class processor
 - Up to 461,000 Logic Elements and 12.7 Gbps SerDes
 - Path to QML-V and QML-Y qualification
