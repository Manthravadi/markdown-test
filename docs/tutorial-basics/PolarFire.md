Reduce power by 50% over equivalent SRAM FPGAs. PolarFire FPGAs combine low cost and SerDes and DSP resources to satisfy a range of high-speed and compute-intensive systems constrained by low power requirements and small form factors.
- Cost-optimized, lowest power in their class
- 250 Mbps to 12.7 Gbps transceivers
- 100K to 500K Logic Elements (LEs), up to 33 MB of RAM
- Best-in-class security and exceptional reliability
