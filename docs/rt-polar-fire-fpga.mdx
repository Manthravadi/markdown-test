# RT PolarFire FPGA

![RT PolarFire FPGA](/img/pages/rt-polar-fire-fpga/rt-polar-fire-fpga-banner.png "RT PolarFire FPGA")
<br />


Our flexible and easy-to-use reprogrammable radiation-tolerant PolarFire FPGAs can streamline the design of high-speed data paths within space payloads. These FPGAs offer expanded logic density and higher performance, which provide significant improvement in signal processing throughput. They also offer immunity to configuration Single Event Upsets (SEUs).
 - Up to 50% lower power SONOS-based FPGAs
 - 481,000 Logic Elements and up to 12.7 Gbps SerDes
 - Path to QML-V qualification
